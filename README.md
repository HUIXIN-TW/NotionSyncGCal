# Notion Synchronise with Google Calendar

> command-line interface to sync data between Notion and Google Calendar.

Do you find yourself juggling between Notion and Google Calendar to manage your events? Fret not! This awesome code is here to save your day. It magically extracts event details from your Notion Dashboard and seamlessly integrates them into your Google Calendar events. But wait, there's more! It even adds a handy URL to your GCal event, so you can effortlessly jump back to the specific Notion Page related to the event. How cool is that?

**Warning**: Proceed with caution! This repo wields the power to make changes to your Notion database and Google Calendar. So, if you're not confident about what you're doing, buckle up and brace yourself for some unexpected surprises.

# Sychronise Notion with Google Calendar

Go to the terminal, and change the folder to where these script are.:

```bash
cd src
```

Run the code to activate the connection between Notion and Google Calendar:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

At the first time, the page will be redirected to `Choose an account` page, and then click or log in your account. Just click `Continue`, and then `Continue`. Finally, close the authentication window. Go back to the terminal, you will see:

All commends and its comment in main.py are in `main.py`. You can change them as you want. I will explain most of them.

- Update from notion event needed to updated to google calendar (default)

  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```

  You will see the following message if you successfully connect to your google calendar. Type enter to continue and the code will start to run. If you do not want it run, type `Ctrl + C` to stop it.

  <img src="./assets/success.png" width="600" height="auto">

  If you hit enter, you will see the following message. It means that the code is running. You can check your google calendar to see if it works.

- Update from all notion tasks to google calendar

  ```bash
  python3 main.py -na
  ```

- Update from google time which is in Notion, and create google new events which is not in Notion

  ```bash
  python3 main.py -gt
  ```

- Create google new events only

  ```bash
  python3 main.py -gc
  ```

- Replace all content of google event
  (I don't recommend using this function since my most contents are made by Notion tasks. However, it is still needed sometimes such as downloading events into notion at the first time)

  ```bash
  python3 main.py -ga
  ```

- Delete google events which is ticked in Notion

  ```bash
  python3 main.py -r
  ```

You can use prettier to format your code. It is a good tool to make your code more readable. In this `.prettierrc` configuration, we use the "overrides" key to specify formatting rules for different file types.

Note: Prettier is primarily designed for formatting JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and other web-related languages. It does not have built-in support for formatting Python code.

Install Prettier

```bash
npm install -g prettier
```

```bash
