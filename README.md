# Notion Synchronise with Google Calendar
The code will extract the event name, date/time, a category, and extra information (text) from the Notion Dashboard and integrate that information into your GCal event. Additionally, it will also add a URL source code the GCal event so you can click on the URL and automatically be brought over to the specific Notion Page that your event is at.

WARNING: This repo will access Notion's database and Google Calendar if you do not know what are you doing, it may cause unwanted changes.

## Current Capabilities:
- update events from google cal to notion
- update events from notion to google cal

### Functions:

- Able to name the required Notion columns whatever you want and have the code work
- Able to add in end times and sync that across both platforms
- Able to decide if a date in Notion will make an event at a desired time or if it will make an All-day event
- Ability to change timezones by changing `timecode` and `timezone` in `notion_setting`
- Ability to change the date range by changing `goback_days` and `goforward_days` in `notion_setting`
