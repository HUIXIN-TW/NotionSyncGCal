# Notion Synchronise with Google Calendar
The code will extract the event name, date/time, category, and extra information (text) from the Notion Dashboard and integrate that information into your GCal event. It will also add a URL source code to the GCal event so you can click on the URL and automatically be brought over to the specific Notion Page your event is at.

WARNING: This repo will access Notion's database and Google Calendar if you do not know what you are doing, it may cause unwanted changes.

## Current Capabilities:
- update events from google cal to notion
- update events from notion to google cal

### Functions:
- Ability to change timezones by changing `timecode` and `timezone` in `notion_setting`
- Ability to change the date range by changing `goback_days` and `goforward_days` in `notion_setting.json`
- Able to decide the default length of new GCal events by changing `event_length` in `notion_setting.json`
- Option to delete gCal events if checked off as `Done?` column in Notion
- Sync across *multiple calendars* and choose which calendar you would like to sync by changing `gcal_dic` and `gcal_dic_key_to_value` in  `notion_setting.json`
- Able to name the required Notion columns whatever you want and have the code work by changing `page_property` in `notion_setting.json`
- credential and OAuth consent screen with google calendar scope

        - "gcal_default_id": "YOUR CALENDAR ID",

    - Enter your default calendar at least. If you want to add multiple calendars, separate them by `,`

# Sychronise

- Update from notion to google

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

    At the first time, the page will be redirected to `Choose an account` page, and then click or log in your account. Just click `Continue`, and then `Continue`. Finally, close the authentication window. Go back to the terminal, you will see:
    <img src="./assets/refresh.png" width="600" height="auto">

    Type this again

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

- Update from google time which is in Notion, and create google new events which is not in Notion

    ```bash
    python3 main.py -gt
    ```

- Create google new events only

    ```bash
    python3 main.py -gc
    ```

- Replace all content of google event
(I don't recommend using this function since my most contents are made by Notion tasks. However, it is still needed sometimes such as downloading events into notion at the first time)

    ```bash
    python3 main.py -ga
    ```

- Delete google events which is ticked in Notion

    ```bash
    python3 main.py -r
    ```
